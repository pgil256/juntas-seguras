Use a Payment Processor with Escrow Features

Instead of relying on direct peer-to-peer transfer, use a provider (like Stripe Connect, PayPal for Platforms, etc.) that can hold funds in escrow or a managed balance.

Each user contributes to a pooled balance that’s actually managed by your payment provider.

KYC (Know Your Customer) and Identity Verification

At signup, require identity checks for all participants. This helps reduce fraudulent signups or fake identities.

Payment processors often handle this for you if you integrate their “marketplace” or “connect” features.

Controlled Disbursements

Don’t release funds directly from user to user. Instead, once the contribution window closes for a given round (say Week 1), your system initiates a single payout to that round’s designated recipient from the pooled account.

This keeps a clear audit trail of exactly who paid in and who got the payout.

Robust Ledger & Audit Logging

Maintain an internal ledger (a database table) that records every transaction: who contributed, date/time, and how much.

Track total amounts in your escrow account and match them to the sum of each user’s contributions.

Have an audit log of every event (user signed up, user contributed, user received payout) for dispute resolution.

Automated Notifications & Time Windows

Automate “round start” and “round end” notifications so contributors know exactly when to send money.

Disburse funds only after all contributions have been received (or after a cutoff date), and only to the designated recipient for that period.
