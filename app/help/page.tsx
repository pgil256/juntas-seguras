  general: [
    {
      question: "What is Juntas Seguras?",
      answer:
        "Juntas Seguras is a platform that helps you create and manage savings pools with friends, family, or community members. It's based on the traditional 'tanda' or 'susu' concept where group members contribute regularly, and each member takes turns receiving the pool of money.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does a savings pool work?",
      answer:
        "Each member contributes a fixed amount on a regular schedule (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly). The pooled amount is given to one member at a time in a predetermined order until all members have received their payout. This continues until the pool's duration ends.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is Juntas Seguras free to use?",
      answer:
        "Basic features are free for all users. We charge a small service fee of 1% on payouts to maintain the platform and ensure secure transactions. Premium features are available to subscribers at $5 per month.",
    },
    {
      question: "How safe is my information?",
      answer:
        "We use bank-level encryption to protect your personal and financial information. We also implement two-factor authentication, regular security audits, and strict access controls to ensure your data stays secure.",
    },
  ],
  account: [
    {
      question: "How do I create an account?",
      answer:
        "Click on 'Sign Up' on the homepage and follow the instructions. You'll need to provide your email address, create a password, and verify your email. For enhanced security, we recommend setting up two-factor authentication once your account is created.",
    },
    {
      question: "How can I reset my password?",
      answer:
        "Click on 'Forgot Password' on the login page. Enter your registered email address, and we'll send you a link to reset your password. If you don't receive the email, check your spam folder or contact our support team.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I have multiple accounts?",
      answer:
        "No, each user is limited to one account. This helps maintain the integrity of our pools and ensures fair participation. If you need to change your email address, you can do so in your account settings.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I delete my account?",
      answer:
        "To delete your account, go to Account Settings â†’ Privacy, and click on 'Delete Account'. Note that you cannot delete your account if you have active pools or pending transactions.",
    },
  ],
  pools: [
    {
      question: "How do I create a new pool?",
      answer:
        "Click on the 'Create Pool' button from your dashboard. Follow the steps to set up the pool parameters, including the contribution amount, frequency, number of members, and duration. You can then invite members to join your pool.",
    },
    {
      question: "How many pools can I join?",
      answer:
        "You can join as many pools as you'd like, but we recommend carefully considering your financial capacity before joining multiple pools. Ensure you can meet all contribution commitments on time.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is the payout order determined?",
      answer:
        "By default, the payout order is randomly assigned when the pool starts. However, the pool administrator can adjust the order if all members agree. In some cases, members can request specific positions based on their needs.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if a member doesn't pay?",
      answer:
        "If a member misses a payment, they'll receive automatic reminders. If they continue to miss payments, the pool administrator can take action, which may include removing them from the pool. The system has safeguards to help ensure the integrity of the pool is maintained.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I leave a pool once it's started?",
      answer:
        "You can leave a pool, but there are some restrictions to protect other members. If you've already received your payout, you must continue to make contributions until the end. If you haven't received a payout, you can leave and receive your contributed funds back, minus any applicable fees.",
    },
  ],
  payments: [
    {
      question: "What payment methods are accepted?",
      answer:
        "We accept bank transfers, debit cards, and major digital payment platforms like PayPal, Venmo, and Zelle. Credit cards are also accepted, but may include an additional processing fee of 2.5%.",
    },
    {
      question: "How often do I need to contribute?",
      answer:
        "Contribution frequency depends on how your pool is set up. Pools can be weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly. The system will automatically remind you when your contribution is due.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are there any fees for using Juntas Seguras?",
      answer:
        "Basic account features are free. We charge a 1% service fee on payouts to cover transaction costs and platform maintenance. Premium features require a subscription of $5 per month.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens to my money between contributions and payouts?",
      answer:
        "All funds are held in a secure escrow account until they're distributed to the designated member according to the pool schedule. We never use pool funds for any other purpose.",
    },
  ],
  security: [
    {
      question: "How do you protect my financial information?",
      answer:
        "We use bank-level encryption (256-bit SSL) for all data transmission and storage. We don't store complete payment information on our servers. All transactions are processed through our secure payment partners.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if someone scams me in a pool?",
      answer:
        "We have multiple safeguards to prevent scams, including identity verification, payment protection, and dispute resolution. If you suspect fraudulent activity, contact our support team immediately, and we'll investigate.",
    },
    {
      question: "Should I join pools with people I don't know?",
      answer:
        "We recommend joining pools with people you know and trust. If you join public pools, review the pool history and member ratings carefully. Our secure payment system helps reduce risks, but personal trust is still important.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you verify users' identities?",
      answer:
        "We use a combination of email verification, phone verification, and optional ID verification for enhanced security. For pools with higher contribution amounts, we require additional verification steps.",
